        147 different items in Detroit. The installation has a map of Detroit displayed on a
        large touch screen monitor. Tapping the map brings up the closest video in a separate monitor.
        Visible hotspots on the map representing viewed item slowly fade out over time. Implemented using
        browser technology and WebVTT for Spanish subtitling.

        Thesis Project: Monitoring and Analysis of an Experimental Passive Solar Envelope House.
      </p>
      <p>
        Implemented a microcomputer-based monitoring system for measuring the performance of an experimental
        passive solar 'envelope' house built in Leverett MA. Extended a small single board computer (KIM-1)
        with an analog interface for measuring multiple temperature sensors and solar insolation using a pyranometer
        installed on the peak of the roof. The single-board computer saved sensor data every 15 minutes on magnetic
        tape. programs on the Apple II in BASIC and machine language to do solar performance analyses
        of the house and display and print graphs.
