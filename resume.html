        <p>
          Directed technology development for the Concord Consortium. Responsibilities included
          hiring, budgeting, technology acquisition and development, developing licensing strategies,
          reviewing contracts, assisting with proposal development, and management of software and
          hardware development.

          In November 2011 the Google Foundation awarded Concord Consortium a grant to develop an
          HTML5 version of <a href="http://mw.concord.org/modeler/">Molecular Workbench</a>,
          an award-winning Java-based physics simulation. Extended the initial scope and created
          a more general framework for authoring and deploying interactives integrating simulations
          running in multiple modeling engines, data collection from sensors and probes, real-time
          graphing, and data tables.
          Results statements: organizations and interactives.

          focuses on studying how computational thinking, primarily through numerical simulation
          and computer-aided design tools, can enhance engineering education in high schools
          (see <a href="http://energy.concord.org">http://energy.concord.org</a> for more information).
          Project developed Energy2D: a computational simulation modeling conduction, convection,
          and radiation and Energy3D: an application for designing buildings using a WYSIWYG 3D user interface.

          2007-2010; centered on the dragons and related organisms that previously served as genetic models
          in previous Concord Consortium projects. Students were further supported in seeking out gene
          locations through the bioinformatics technique of Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) analysis.
          Results demonstrated the curriculum and software increased student understanding of concepts
          such as genetic recombination and inbred strains.

          Architected and implemented the software for NYC-based video artists Roberta Friedman and
          Daniel Loewenthal's interactive video installation. Roberta and Dan shot short videos at
          147 different locations in Detroit. The installation has a map of Detroit displayed on a
          large touch screen monitor. Tapping the map brings up the closest video in a separate monitor.
          Visible hotspots on the map representing viewed location slowly fade out over time. Implemented using
          browser technology and WebVTT for Spanish subtitling.

          Worked with NYC-based video artists Graham Weinbren and Roberta Friedman to complete the design
          and programming of the editing and run-time software for an interactive video art
          piece in which viewers explore non-linear narratives by touching areas on the video screen.
          The run-time software controls the queuing and playing of video and audio from three videodisk
          players as well as reading viewer input from the touch screen.  The editing software was
          designed to enable the film maker to easily specify the non-linear interactions.  The software
          was written in Pascal and Z80 assembly language.

          Thesis Project: Monitoring and Analysis of an Experimental Passive Solar Envelope House.
        </p>
        <p>
          Implemented a microcomputer-based monitoring system for measuring the performance of an experimental
          passive solar 'envelope' house built in Leverett MA. Extended a small single board computer (KIM-1)
          with an analog interface for measuring multiple temperature sensors and solar insolation using a pyranometer
          installed on the peak of the roof. The single-board computer saved sensor data every 15 minutes on magnetic
          tape. Brought the magenetic tapes back to Hampshire and read the stored data using an Apple II
          computer. Wrote programs on the Apple II in BASIC and machine language to do solar performance analyses
          of the house and display and print graphs. Finished writing thesis on the IMSAI 8080 running CPM in
          the basement of the library using Emacs and saving the work on 8" floppies.
